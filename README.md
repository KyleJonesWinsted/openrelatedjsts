# Open Related - JS/TS

Open the Javascript file associated with a Typescript file and vice versa.

## Features

Reads the root and output directories from `tsconfig.json` (if one exists) and opens the Typescript or Javascript file in the corresponding directory. If there is no tsconfig, the extension will do it's best to determine which file to open. Also supports typescript declaration files.

## Usage

When editing a Typescript or Javascript file, open the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` by default) and select `Open Related JS/TS`. You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd+K` followed by `J`.
